## (GEN001260: CAT II) (Previously â€“ G037) The SA will ensure all system log
## files have permissions of 640, or more restrictive.

## Note:  This script has been split into two parts for systems
##        where it's desired to change log file permissions without
##        altering rc.sysinit. Part two isn't required per stig since
##        /var/log/wtmp is not referenced from rsyslog.conf
